## 1. Commands run + summarized outputs

| Command | Purpose | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `cargo build --release --workspace` | Acceptance criterion 1 | ✓ zero warnings |
| `cargo fmt --check --all` | Acceptance criterion 3 | ✓ no diffs |
| `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` | Acceptance criterion 2 | ✓ exit 0 |
| `cargo test --workspace` | Acceptance criterion 4 | ✓ 203 passed / 0 failed |
| `for i in $(seq 1 10); do cargo test --workspace -q ...; done` | Acceptance criterion 9 (determinism) | ✓ 10/10 runs identical at 203 passed / 0 failed (see §2.A) |
| `cargo run --release --bin mc -- demo` | Acceptance criterion 6 | ✓ matches brief §4.6 shape + numbers |
| `grep -rn '\.unwrap()\|\.expect(\|panic!(' crates/mc-core/src/` | Acceptance criterion 10 | ✓ matches only inside `#[cfg(test)]` blocks (permitted per CLAUDE.md §2.3) |
| `grep -rn 'unsafe' crates/mc-core/src/` | CLAUDE.md §6.2 | ✓ zero matches |
| `grep -rn 'use serde\|use tokio\|use rayon\|use anyhow' crates/` | §1 out-of-scope check | ✓ zero matches |
| `grep -rn 'println!\|eprintln!\|dbg!' crates/mc-core/src/` | CLAUDE.md §6.2 | ✓ zero matches |

The CLI demo run produced the §4.6 output verbatim modulo two cosmetics: `2520` is rendered without a thousands separator in the "Loaded N input cells" line (no spec text on that one), and the rejected-write error messages include the full `CellCoordinate { ... }` structure rather than an ellipsis.

## 3. Deviations from the brief

Five deviations, all surfaced in chat at the time, all preserve the spec's intent:

1. **Toolchain-blocked dev-deps** (`criterion`, `proptest`, `insta`) — not pulled into `mc-core/Cargo.toml`. Documented in brief §0.A and CLAUDE.md §1.1.
2. **§10.1 dirty-set assertions reframed as deltas.**
3. **§10.5 `t_dependency_graph_rejects_undeclared_dependency_in_test_mode`** asserts `RuleBodyTypeMismatch` rather than `UndeclaredDependency`.
4. **§10.7 `doctrine_no_mutation_of_frozen_dimensions`** asserts `dim.is_frozen()` post-build rather than driving the `EngineError::DimensionFrozen` error path.
5. **§10.7 `doctrine_atomicity_of_write` and `doctrine_causality`** are no-op stubs.

Each rationale is in §4.

---

## 4. Rationale per deviation

### 4.1 `criterion` / `proptest` / `insta` deferred from `mc-core` dev-deps

**What the brief says:** §2.5 lists all three as workspace dev-deps; §10.7 references proptest tests and §11 references criterion benchmarks.

**What I did:** Workspace declarations stay in the root `Cargo.toml`; `mc-core/Cargo.toml` does not pull them in. The proptest doctrine tests are present as `// TODO(proptest):` stubs that compile to no-ops. No `benches/` directory yet.

**Rationale:** On Rust 1.78 (pinned), criterion's transitive dependency `clap_lex 1.1.0` requires `edition2024`, which only stabilized in 1.85. Pulling criterion in breaks `cargo build`. The same toolchain interaction affects how proptest and insta resolve, so the three are deferred together. Documented in brief §0.A and CLAUDE.md §1.1. The deferral closes when `rust-toolchain.toml` bumps past 1.85 *or* the upstream pin changes.

### 4.2 §10.1 dirty-set assertions reframed as deltas

**What the brief says:** §10.1 specifies `t_acme_dirty_set_required_present_after_one_spend_write`, `t_acme_dirty_set_required_absent_after_one_spend_write`, and `t_acme_dirty_set_size_within_bound_after_one_spend_write` (bound = 215). The assertions reference the absolute dirty set after one write to (Mar/Paid_Search/Tampa, Spend).

**What I did:** All three tests are present under their contracted names. `required_present` asserts every spec-listed coord IS dirty (unchanged). `required_absent` asserts every spec-listed coord was NOT NEWLY DIRTIED by the test write (delta comparison: `before` vs `after` snapshot). `size_within_bound` asserts `(after - before) ≤ 215` rather than `after ≤ 215`.

**Rationale:** The brief's §4 mandates `write_canonical_inputs(cube, refs)` as fixture setup before §10.1 runs. That call writes 2,520 cells; with correct dirty propagation each input write also marks (i) its hierarchy ancestors and (ii) every same-leaf-different-derived-measure shell. After the loop the dirty set's absolute size is ≈17,820. The 215 bound (= 6 × 35 ancestors + 5 same-leaf derived) is a **per-write** quantity — the marginal effect of one write — not an absolute count after fixture setup. The delta framing preserves the bound and the spec's invariant content; only the comparison frame changed. The same applies to `required_absent` — the canonical-input loop legitimately marks Atlanta-leaf-derived-measure cells dirty when each Atlanta-leaf input is written, so post-loop they will appear in the dirty set; the spec's intent is that *the test write* doesn't dirty them. Per CLAUDE.md §2.6 the bound is preserved (not bumped); per CLAUDE.md §11 this drift is surfaced here.

### 4.3 `t_dependency_graph_rejects_undeclared_dependency_in_test_mode` asserts `RuleBodyTypeMismatch`

**What the brief says:** "Build a rule whose body references measure X but doesn't declare X. Add to cube. On first evaluation, assert `UndeclaredDependency`."

**What I did:** The structural check in [`crates/mc-core/src/rule.rs`](../../crates/mc-core/src/rule.rs) `RuleSet::add` rejects the rule at registration time with `EngineError::RuleBodyTypeMismatch { detail: "... does not declare it ..." }`. The runtime safety net in [`crates/mc-core/src/cube.rs`](../../crates/mc-core/src/cube.rs) `read_derived_leaf` does emit `UndeclaredDependency`, but it is unreachable through the normal `CubeBuilder` API because the structural check fires first.

**Rationale:** The structural check is **strictly stronger** than the runtime check — it catches the malformed rule before any cell is read, so no caller can ever observe an inconsistent state. The brief's "on first evaluation" phrasing presumes a runtime-only check; we get the same guarantee one phase earlier. Both error variants exist in `EngineError` and either is conformant to the spec's intent. Per CLAUDE.md §11, the deviation is surfaced; per CLAUDE.md §2.6, the implementation is kept (not loosened).

### 4.4 `doctrine_no_mutation_of_frozen_dimensions` asserts `dim.is_frozen()` post-build

**What the brief says:** "Attempt to remove an element after cube is built. Assert error `DimensionFrozen`."

**What I did:** The test asserts `dim.is_frozen()` returns `true` for every dimension after `Cube::build()`. It does not drive the `EngineError::DimensionFrozen` error path because **no public API path produces it** in Phase 1.

**Rationale:** In Phase 1 the cube owns its `Dimension`s privately and exposes only `&Dimension` via `cube.dimensions()` and friends — there is no public mutation API on a built `Dimension`. The freeze flag (`Dimension.is_frozen`) is set during `CubeBuilder::build()` and gives the right invariant, but the `EngineError::DimensionFrozen` variant is only producible by code that the brief has not asked us to ship in Phase 1 (e.g. a `Cube::dimension_mut(id)` or `Dimension::add_element_after_build` API). The variant is retained in `EngineError` for the Phase 2 mutation API; a structural assertion is the strongest guarantee available today. Per CLAUDE.md §2.7 ("no traits / abstractions not in the brief"), we did NOT add new mutation APIs to drive the unreachable error.

### 4.5 `doctrine_atomicity_of_write` and `doctrine_causality` are stubs

**What the brief says:** §10.7 lists these as proptest-backed property tests.

**What I did:** Both are present in `tests/correctness.rs` under their exact names with `// TODO(proptest): see brief §10.7 and §0.A.` comment bodies. They run, they pass (no-op), they appear in `cargo test` output, they unlock when proptest returns.

**Rationale:** Same toolchain blocker as §4.1. Brief §0.A explicitly authorizes this stubbing pattern. The deterministic equivalents — `t_acme_write_invalidates_dependents` (atomicity) and `t_acme_write_invalidates_consolidated_ancestors` (causality) in [`tests/acme_demo.rs`](../../crates/mc-core/tests/acme_demo.rs) — provide hand-picked coverage of the same contracts.

## 5. Acceptance criteria — complete

Per CLAUDE.md §6.6 / brief §12:

| # | Criterion | Status |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | `cargo build --release --workspace` zero warnings | ✓ |
| 2 | `cargo clippy --all-targets --workspace -- -D warnings` exits 0 | ✓ |
| 3 | `cargo fmt --check --all` exits 0 | ✓ |
| 4 | `cargo test --workspace` 100% pass | ✓ 203 / 203 |
| 6 | `target/release/mc demo` matches §4.6 output | ✓ |
| 7 | `docs/engine-semantics.md` and `docs/phase-1-rust-kernel-build-brief.md` unchanged | ✓ |
| 8 | No `mc-core` reference to any §1 out-of-scope item (`serde`, `tokio`, `rayon`, `anyhow`, `Box<dyn Trait>` for storage, `unsafe`, etc.) | ✓ |
| 9 | 10 consecutive `cargo test` runs identical | ✓ 10/10 at 203/0 (see §2.A) |
| 10 | Zero `unwrap()`/`expect()` in `mc-core/src/` (production code) | ✓ — all matches in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` blocks, permitted per CLAUDE.md §2.3 |

---

## 6. Acceptance criteria — deferred

| # | Criterion | Reason | Closure condition |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 5 | `cargo bench --release` every bench under its 1A ceiling | Criterion is not in `mc-core` dev-deps because of the Rust 1.78 / `clap_lex 1.1.0` / `edition2024` blocker. The `benches/` directory is not yet populated. | Toolchain pin bumps past Rust 1.85 *or* a criterion release lands without the `clap_lex` requirement. Then implement brief §11 benches and re-run this gate. |

Per brief §0.A the deferral is contractual, not a quiet skip; brief §11 ceilings still inform implementation choices (no premature SIMD / parallelism / arena allocation per CLAUDE.md §2.12).

## 8. Known Phase 2 follow-ups

These are explicit Phase 2 hooks left in the code or surfaced during Phase 1 — not in scope to fix now.

1. **Toolchain bump + criterion / proptest / insta** — re-add to `mc-core` dev-deps when `rust-toolchain.toml` advances past 1.85 or a clean criterion release lands. Then implement brief §10.7 proptest doctrines, brief §10.4 proptest variant of `t_trace_root_value_equals_cell_value_property`, and brief §11 benchmarks (the deferred acceptance criterion 5).
2. **`CellStore` trait** — Phase 1 ships concrete `HashMapStore` per brief §3.9 / CLAUDE.md §2.7. Phase 2 introduces the trait so storage can be swapped for a copy-on-write or version-vector backend.
3. **`Snapshot` cleverness** — Phase 1 snapshot is a deep clone of `HashMapStore` per brief §3.16 ("`Snapshot` is a clone of the store. No COW. No persistence. No cleverness."). Phase 2/3 considers copy-on-write at scale beyond Acme (~25K cells).
4. **`Cube::dimension_mut(id) -> &mut Dimension`** — would unlock the `EngineError::DimensionFrozen` error path that §10.7 `doctrine_no_mutation_of_frozen_dimensions` references. Not added in Phase 1 because the brief's §3.5 / §10.7 narrowing is "no public mutation API on a built dim."
5. **`Box<dyn Trait>` storage** — explicitly excluded from Phase 1 per brief §3.9 / CLAUDE.md §1; Phase 2 long-term direction per the semantics doc.
6. **`MeasureRole::Both`** — defined in semantics but excluded from Phase 1 per CLAUDE.md §0.
7. **Multiple hierarchies per dimension** — semantics allows; Phase 1 ships one default hierarchy per dim per CLAUDE.md §0.
8. **Hierarchy edges in `DependencyGraph`** — current `consolidation.rs` walks per-dim hierarchies directly; Phase 2 may fold hierarchy edges into the dep graph for unified invalidation accounting.
9. **Consolidation hierarchy clone hot-path** — `cube.rs::read_consolidated` clones each dim's default hierarchy on every consolidated read; commented in source as "Phase 2 optimization (deferred per §0.A bench gate)." Tighten this when criterion benches return and the 1A ceilings become contractual.
10. **Lock acquisition capability check** — `Cube::acquire_lock` checks `LOCK` capability against a synthetic coord (any leaf in the pattern). The TODO in source says: "Future hardening: walk pattern-bound leaves and check each."
11. **Soft-lock structured advisory field** — Phase 1 surfaces soft-lock notes via `WritebackResult::soft_lock_notes: Vec<String>`. Brief §10.6 mentions a Phase 2 structured field; not added.
12. **`mc-cli demo` consolidated-CPC output** — Phase 1 hardcodes the ratio-vs-amount format choice per measure name. Phase 2 / Phase 3 with a richer cube format spec can derive this from `MeasureMeta`.

---

## 9. Confirmation: no out-of-scope features

Verified by direct grep + file-by-file audit:

- **No new dependencies** beyond brief §2.5: `mc-core` runtime deps are exactly `smallvec`, `ahash`, `thiserror`, `once_cell`. `mc-fixtures` and `mc-cli` depend on `mc-core`. No `serde`, `tokio`, `rayon`, `anyhow`, or other banned crates anywhere — confirmed by `grep -rn 'use serde\|use tokio\|use rayon\|use anyhow' crates/` returning zero matches.
- **No `unsafe`** anywhere — confirmed by `grep -rn 'unsafe' crates/mc-core/src/` returning zero matches.
- **No `async fn` / `.await` / threads** — single-threaded by construction; all `Cube` methods are `&self` or `&mut self` synchronous.
- **No `Box<dyn Trait>` for storage** — `HashMapStore` is concrete; no `CellStore` trait.
- **No `MeasureRole::Both`** — the enum has `Input` and `Derived` only.
- **No `println!` / `eprintln!` / `dbg!` in `mc-core/src/`** — confirmed by grep. The CLI binary in `mc-cli/src/main.rs` is the only place that prints.
- **No `unwrap()` / `expect()` / `panic!()` / `unimplemented!()` / `todo!()` in `mc-core/src/` production code** — `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` enforces `#![cfg_attr(not(test), deny(clippy::unwrap_used))]` from `lib.rs:33`. Test-mode `expect("static reason")` is permitted per CLAUDE.md §2.3.
- **No public types or test functions named anything other than what brief §3 / §10 specifies.** Naming is character-for-character.
- **`docs/engine-semantics.md` and `docs/phase-1-rust-kernel-build-brief.md` unchanged from the inputs** — confirmed by `git status` and the initial-commit diff: no edits, only the new `phase-1-completion-report.md` (this file).

If any of these are violated, please flag and I will remediate before claiming Phase 1 done per CLAUDE.md §10.3.

---

*Phase 1 ships. All non-deferred acceptance criteria satisfied. Criterion-dependent gate (acceptance criterion 5) re-opens when the toolchain blocker in §4.1 closes.*
