# CURRENT_STATE

> **What's live right now.** Update whenever a phase ships, a gate flips, or a deferral closes.

**Last updated:** 2026-05-01 (Phase 2A cold-path benchmark expansion complete)
**Last Phase 1A commit:** `bee2812` — *mc-core: update lib.rs doc-comment to point at docs/specs/* (Phase 1A kernel at `4aa674a`)
**Last Phase 1B + Phase 2A commit:** `48d52e9` — *bench: complete Phase 2A cold-path benchmark expansion* (Phase 1B and Phase 2A bundled into one commit; tag `phase-2a-cold-path-baseline` at this hash)
**Branch:** `main` (tracking `origin/main` at github.com/edwinlov3tt/mc-v2)

## What's shipping

- **Phase 1A — Rust kernel for the Acme demo.** Complete. See [`reports/phase-1-completion-report.md`](./reports/phase-1-completion-report.md).
- **Phase 1B — Benchmark Baseline + PERF.md.** Complete 2026-05-01. Acceptance criterion 5 closed via Cargo.lock transitive pins (no toolchain bump). See [`PERF.md`](./PERF.md).
- **Phase 2A — Cold-Path Benchmark Expansion.** Complete 2026-05-01. Both Phase 1B measurement gaps closed: cold consolidation rows added against §11.2 ceilings (PERF.md §6.7); synthetic no-deps write fixture added against §11.1 50 µs ceiling (PERF.md §6.8). Two new diagnostic suites (snapshot clone PERF.md §6.9; hierarchy ancestor mark microbench PERF.md §6.10). **No `crates/mc-core/src/` files modified.** See [`reports/phase-2a-completion-report.md`](./reports/phase-2a-completion-report.md).

## What's queued

- **Phase 2B — Kernel Optimization (not scheduled).** Phase 2A's data is now in [`PERF.md`](./PERF.md) §6.7–§6.10 + §9. Candidates with magnitudes: hierarchy mark closure (PERF.md §9.3 — marginal cost per ancestor measured in §6.10), `is_consolidated_coord` fast path (§9.2), `read_consolidated` hierarchy clone hot path (§9.4 — newly measurable on cold reads now that §6.7 is real), snapshot COW (§9.5 — quantified by §6.9). **Pick from data.**

## Active ADRs

- [`decisions/0001-phase-1-scope.md`](./decisions/0001-phase-1-scope.md) — Phase 1 scope: smallest kernel that runs the Acme demo. **Status:** Accepted.

## Build / test / lint state (at HEAD)

| Gate | Command | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Build | `cargo build --release --workspace` | ✓ zero warnings |
| Format | `cargo fmt --check --all` | ✓ |
| Lint | `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` | ✓ |
| Tests | `cargo test --workspace` | ✓ 209 / 0 (203 Phase 1A/1B contract tests + 6 new mc-fixtures unit tests for Phase 2A synthetic builders) |
| Determinism (10×) | `for i in $(seq 1 10); do cargo test --workspace -q ...; done` | ✓ 10 / 10 identical |
| CLI demo | `cargo run --release --bin mc -- demo` | ✓ matches brief §4.6 |
| Benchmarks | `cargo bench --workspace` | ✓ Phase 1B baseline + Phase 2A cold-path expansion both green. Numbers in [`PERF.md`](./PERF.md) §6 (Phase 1B) + §6.7–§6.10 (Phase 2A). All brief §11.2 cold consolidation 1A ceilings now pass on real cold reads. The §11.1 synthetic `bench_write_input_leaf_no_deps` ceiling closes on the new minimal-hierarchy fixture (PERF.md §6.8). Phase 1B's two caveat banners are now closure-noted, not deferrals. |

## Toolchain + dependency state

- Rust 1.78 pinned in [`../rust-toolchain.toml`](../rust-toolchain.toml).
- `mc-core` runtime deps: `smallvec`, `ahash`, `thiserror`, `once_cell`. Nothing else.
- `mc-core` dev deps: `mc-fixtures` (path), `criterion = "0.5"` (workspace, default-features=false). Added in Phase 1B.
- `mc-fixtures` and `mc-cli` depend on `mc-core` only.
- **Cargo.lock pins (Phase 1B):** `clap → 4.4.18`, `clap_lex → 0.6.0`, `half → 2.4.1`. These pre-edition2024 versions keep criterion buildable on Rust 1.78. Documented in [`PERF.md`](./PERF.md) §5.
- **Still deferred:** `proptest` and `insta` declared at workspace level only; not pulled into `mc-core`. The toolchain blocker is no longer the reason — they're paired with §10.7 doctrines and snapshot tests that are Phase 2 work. See CLAUDE.md §1.1.

---

## Open deferrals (Phase 1A acceptance criteria)

None. Acceptance criterion 5 (`cargo bench --release` under §11 1A ceilings) closed 2026-05-01 in Phase 1B. See [`PERF.md`](./PERF.md) §6 for the table and [`reports/phase-1-completion-report.md`](./reports/phase-1-completion-report.md) §6 for the closure record. One known fixture-mismatch (`write_input_leaf_no_deps`) documented in PERF.md §7.3 as a non-regression for Phase 2 attention.

All Phase 1A criteria (1–10) now satisfied. Full table in [`reports/phase-1-completion-report.md`](./reports/phase-1-completion-report.md) §5.

---

## Deviations from the brief that are still in effect

These are documented in [`reports/phase-1-completion-report.md`](./reports/phase-1-completion-report.md) §3–§4 and remain active until a future spec or amendment supersedes them:

1. **`proptest` / `insta` still out of `mc-core` dev-deps.** `criterion` was restored in Phase 1B (2026-05-01) via Cargo.lock transitive pins (`clap` → 4.4.18, `clap_lex` → 0.6.0, `half` → 2.4.1) — the §11 bench gate is now active. `proptest` and `insta` remain deferred for a different reason: the §10.7 doctrines and snapshot-style tests that need them are Phase 2 work, not Phase 1B scope. Pulling the crates in without using them would just lengthen `cargo build`. See CLAUDE.md §1.1.
2. **§10.1 dirty-set assertions reframed as deltas** — the bound is preserved (215); the comparison frame changed because `write_canonical_inputs` legitimately accumulates marks across 2,520 input writes.
3. **§10.5 `t_dependency_graph_rejects_undeclared_dependency_in_test_mode`** asserts `RuleBodyTypeMismatch` (registration-time) rather than `UndeclaredDependency` (runtime). Strictly stronger guarantee.
4. **§10.7 `doctrine_no_mutation_of_frozen_dimensions`** asserts `dim.is_frozen()` post-build because no public mutation API exists in Phase 1; `EngineError::DimensionFrozen` variant retained for Phase 2.
5. **§10.7 `doctrine_atomicity_of_write` and `doctrine_causality`** are no-op stubs per §0.A; deterministic equivalents in `tests/acme_demo.rs`.
6. ~~**§11.1 `bench_write_input_leaf_no_deps`** measures ~165 µs (1A ceiling: 50 µs).~~ **Closed 2026-05-01 in Phase 2A.** The synthetic minimal-hierarchy fixture `mc_fixtures::build_minimal_cube` now lets the brief's "no-dependents" cost be measured directly — see PERF.md §6.8. The Acme `bench_write_input_leaf_no_deps` row remains in `leaf_read_write.rs` as a documented Acme-fixture path measurement; the new `synthetic_no_deps::write_input_leaf_no_deps_synthetic` row evaluates the brief's 50 µs 1A ceiling.

---

## Known Phase 2 follow-ups

Source-tagged hooks and surfaced findings. **Not scheduled.** Full lists in [`reports/phase-1-completion-report.md`](./reports/phase-1-completion-report.md) §8 (Phase 1A) and [`PERF.md`](./PERF.md) §8 / §9 (Phase 1B).

**Phase 2A closed Phase 1B's measurement gaps.** All four follow-ups Phase 2A enumerated are now measured (PERF.md §6.7–§6.10); the open follow-ups below are Phase 2B optimization candidates whose magnitudes the new data quantifies.

Optimization candidates surfaced from current data:

- `CellStore` trait introduction (Phase 1 ships concrete `HashMapStore`).
- `Snapshot` copy-on-write at scale (Phase 1 ships deep-clone).
- Hierarchy-clone hot-path in `cube.rs::read_consolidated`.
- Lock-acquisition capability check hardening.
- Toolchain bump → unlocks `proptest` / `insta` for the §10.7 doctrines and any insta-driven snapshot tests (PERF.md §9.7 housekeeping checklist).

## How to update this file

When a phase ships:

1. Update **Last updated**, **Last commit**, **Branch**.
2. Update **What's shipping / What's queued / Active ADRs**.
3. Update the build / test / lint state table.
4. Update the test count table if any tests were added.
5. Move closed deferrals out of the table; add closure dates to the relevant phase report.
6. Add an ADR if a new scope-level decision was made; link it in **Active ADRs**.

When a deferral closes (e.g. `cargo bench` becomes unblocked):

1. Move the row out of **Open deferrals**.
2. Update the relevant report's §6 to reflect closure.
3. If the closure required a decision (e.g. "we chose to bump Rust to 1.85"), write an ADR.
